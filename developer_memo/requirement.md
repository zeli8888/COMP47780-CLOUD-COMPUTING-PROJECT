# COMP47780 – Cloud Computing Project

## Projects on Healthcare Big Data
**Deadline: 07 December 2025**

---

## Introduction

Healthcare big data refers to the vast and complex sets of health-related information collected from various sources, such as electronic health records, medical devices, wearable technology, clinical trials, and research studies. This data encompasses a wide range of patient information, including demographics, medical history, diagnostic tests, treatment plans, and outcomes.

Analysing healthcare big data using advanced technologies and data analytics tools allows for a deeper understanding of disease patterns, treatment effectiveness, population health trends, and personalised medicine. By harnessing the power of healthcare big data, healthcare professionals and researchers can make data-driven decisions to improve patient care, enhance operational efficiency, optimise resource allocation, and drive innovation in the healthcare sector.

However, ensuring this data's privacy, security, and ethical handling is of utmost importance to maintain trust and protect individual rights.

We described two projects for handling medical datasets in the following. The students are requested to choose one of the two projects:

---

## Project 1: Healthcare Data Warehouse Management

Various medical datasets are publicly available. For example, the Kaggle[^1] datasets are publicly available and cover a range of applications. There are more than 255,000 datasets. You can choose medical datasets from this site, but you can decide to use other sites. It is up to each student to use a dataset for their project.

In this project, you are asked to develop a cloud-based healthcare data warehouse management solution to store and organise medical data:

**a.** Identify the medical datasets for which you would like to create a cloud-based data warehouse.  
**b.** Define the application you want to use for the collected medical data.  
**c.** Choose a cloud data warehouse solution for your problem.  
**d.** Implement the proposed medical data warehouse on a Hadoop system or equivalent.  
*(Recommendation: Cloudera HDP data platform or AWS platform)*  
**e.** Build a Dashboard for your system that shows how it can be used.

## Project 2: Hadoop/MapReduce Implementation for a Medical Application

In this project, you will gain hands-on experience with the MapReduce programming model building and running a Hadoop application. As explained above, medical datasets are in abundance. In this project, you are asked to implement algorithms to analyse medical datasets using the Hadoop/MapReduce model:

**a.** Identify the medical dataset that you would like to analyse.  
**b.** Clearly define the analysis you want to perform on the medical dataset (e.g., automatic diagnosis, symptom-disorder matching, medical report classification, etc.).  
**c.** Choose the algorithm that you will use to implement your use case.  
**d.** Implement the selected algorithm in Hadoop/MapReduce.  
*(Recommendation: Cloudera HDP data platform or AWS platform)*  
**e.** Build a Dashboard to run your analysis and display the results.

## Project Requirements

### Project Selection
You are asked to choose between two projects. Once you have done that, you need to:

Develop a cloud-based solution for either managing or analysing medical datasets, depending on the project you chose (1 or 2).  
Please follow the instructions as described in the project.

### Project Report Requirements
Produce a project report describing the data set application being studied. This report should contain the following items:

- **Application overview**
- **Objectives**: Briefly describe each goal/objective and whether they have been completed
- **Describe the problem and the collection of the datasets**
- **Explain your methodology and implementation**
- **Discuss the suitability of the tool being used to solve the problem**
- **Describe the features of your software**
- **Give a worked example**
- **Conclusion**
- **References**

### Submission Requirements
Please submit your project within the deadline.

Please submit your project report, source code, and all necessary files to run your implementation.  
You may need to prepare a README file to explain how to execute it.  
Please submit **ONLY one ZIP file**, containing all the necessary files and directories, including the project report.
